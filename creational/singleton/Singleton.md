Example : Runtime class

### Pitfalls
* Often overused
* Difficult to unit test
* If not careful, not thread safe
* Sometimes confused for Factory

### Contrast to Another Patterns
* Singleton returns same instance, Factory returns various instances
* One constructor method with no args, Factory has multiple constructors
* Singleton provides no interface, Factory is interface driven
